# 🌿 Accessibility Rider by Ann K. Chou  
_Collective Care & Creative Access for Inclusive Gatherings_

## ✨ Purpose  
This rider outlines shared access practices to foster dignity, creativity, and interdependence across blind, deaf, hard-of-hearing, neurodivergent, disabled, and multiply marginalized participants.

Access is not an accommodation. It is how we show up for one another.

## 🔑 Core Principles  
- **Access is shared** — not siloed  
- **Flexibility is vital** — we honor rhythm, emotion, rest  
- **Creativity is communication** — multimodal expression is welcome  
- **Lived experience leads** — disabled voices shape access culture

---

## 📋 Pre-Gathering Commitments  
- Share **agenda, slides, and visual materials** at least 48 hrs in advance  
- Confirm **access requests**, including:
  - CART (real-time captioning)
  - ASL/interpretation
  - Audio description
  - Alternate formats (large print, tactile, etc.)
  - Assistant-supported registration or access briefing

- Ensure **alt-text for images** and **descriptions of visual elements**
- Invite attendees to share their access preferences or support needs

---

## 🗣️ During the Gathering  
- Enable **live captions** or CART transcription  
- Identify speakers; speak clearly, slowly, and without jargon  
- Avoid backlighting; **ensure your face is visible** for lip reading  
- Use **gestures, emojis, whiteboards, or objects** to supplement meaning  
- Normalize **non-verbal expression** — creative forms are valid  
- Respect **processing time** and silence between responses  
- Allow access assistants or care partners to contribute

---

## 🧘 Break Time Culture  
- Build in **scheduled breaks** — at least every 60–90 minutes  
- Honor transitions — allow sensory regulation, hydration, movement  
- Let people opt in/out of social time during breaks without pressure  
- Provide quiet breakout spaces or chat pauses where possible

---

## 💬 Language Practices  
- Avoid stigmatizing terms:
  - ❌ “normal,” “able-bodied,” “low/high functioning,” “suffering from”  
  - ✅ Use neutral, person-centered language  
- Invite participants to self-describe identity or modality if desired  
- Accept multiple kinds of presence — typing, listening, movement, silence

---

## 📩 Post-Event Practices  
- Share written **summary**, **transcript**, or **annotated materials**  
- Invite feedback: “How did this feel? What might grow next time?”  
- Reflect on access changes for future events

---

## 🕯️ Closing  
This rider is a living document — not a checklist.  
It reflects co-created care, shaped by disabled wisdom and artistic connection.  
Use it as a template, remix it for your spaces, cite with credit.  
  
Let gatherings be places where **everyone arrives whole**.
