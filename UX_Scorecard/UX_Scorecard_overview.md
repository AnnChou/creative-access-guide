# 🧮 Access-Centered UX Scorecard Overview (v0.7b, work-in-progress, 2025)

_Curated by Ann K. Chou | For public teams building dignity into design_

This scorecard offers a structured way to assess user experience with an **access-first lens** — especially in **public service contexts** where direct user testing is limited or delayed. It combines **inclusive design heuristics**, **audience mapping**, and **behavioral insight** to guide thoughtful, intersectional evaluation.

---

## 📘 Who It's For

- Public sector teams evaluating **digital services, intranet platforms, or policy interfaces**
- Designers with limited access to user testing or feedback pipelines
- Behavioral insight units seeking structured UX heuristics
- Accessibility coordinators mapping **task success**, **comprehension**, and **emotional burden**

## 🛠️ Access-Centered UX Scorecard Development Process (Simplified)

This scorecard was created through an interpretive, access-centered workflow.  
You are welcome to adapt or remix this method for your own use case or evaluation context.

1. **Extract UX Dimensions**  
   Begin by selecting key heuristics from established frameworks  
   _(e.g. Nielsen, HEART, Gerhardt-Powals)_.

2. **Rewrite Dimensions with Care**  
   Reframe language to reflect dignity, inclusion, and access for all kinds of bodies, minds, and modalities.

3. **Define Metrics or Prompts**  
   - If the dimension is measurable, define a practical metric.  
   - If user testing is not available, write an evaluation **prompt** for subjective reflection.

4. **Map to Personas**  
   Pair each dimension with a persona from the Audience Mapping tab.  
   Consider barriers they may face in their role or context  
   _(e.g. policy clarity for neurodiverse staff; platform responsiveness for remote coordinators)_.

5. **Create a Grading Guide**  
   Write a 5-point interpretation scale (A–F) for each prompt, balancing **experience and accessibility impact**.  
   Grade with empathy, nuance, and usability insight.

> 🕯️ This workflow was shaped by lived experience. You can reshape it to serve yours.

## 📂 Tabs Included in v0.7b Spreadsheet

| Tab Name                    | Description |
|----------------------------|-------------|
| `1_UX_Scorecard_w_accessib` | Core tab for evaluating UX dimensions with access prompts and A–F grading |
| `2_Dimens_from_Existing`    | Reference table mapping established UX heuristics to scorecard dimensions (e.g., Nielsen, HEART, Shneiderman) |
| `3_Intranet_metric_to_UX`   | Crosswalk between intranet metrics (e.g. time on page, bounce rate) and UX performance indicators |
| `4_Audience Mapping`        | Persona profiles representing diverse staff roles, needs, and barriers in government contexts |

---

## 🎯 Grading Scale (A–F)

| Grade | Meaning |
|-------|--------|
| A (Excellent) | Fully meets or exceeds expectations across user groups |
| B (Good) | Mostly meets expectations with minor gaps |
| C (Average) | Adequate with visible limitations |
| D (Poor) | Significant usability or accessibility problems |
| F (Failing) | Fails basic standards or excludes key populations |

✅ Grades are color-coded from **green to red** to align with familiar mental models and quickly signal access performance.

📊 Each grade converts to a score:  
`A = 5`, `B = 4`, `C = 3`, `D = 2`, `F = 1` → These are averaged into a **summative score** with a converted final grade.

---

## 🧠 How to Use

1. Open the **Scorecard tab (`1_UX_Scorecard_w_accessib`)**
2. For each UX dimension:
   - Read the prompt and accessibility notes  
   - Grade based on both **user experience** and **intersectional access impact**  
3. Use the **Audience Mapping** tab to apply specific personas — this avoids generic assumptions and deepens empathy
4. Check the summative grade and iterate

> 🕯️ Remember: Scores are a lantern, not a verdict. Use them to illuminate where care is needed.

## 🔍 Audience Mapping Personas

These represent real-world government roles and lived accessibility contexts.

| Persona | Role Description | Key Accessibility Lens |
|--------|------------------|--------------------------|
| Data Officer | High cognitive load & form navigation | Task comprehension + clarity |
| Frontline Clerk | Multilingual, visual learner | Findability + accessibility of visuals |
| Policy Lead | Analytical focus, neurodiverse | Emotional burden + cognitive flow |
| Regional Coordinator | Low bandwidth, remote tools | Platform accessibility + responsiveness |

📌 Use Column G in the Scorecard to pair dimensions with personas and tailor your evaluation.

## ✨ Frameworks Referenced

The scorecard integrates core ideas from:

- **Nielsen’s Heuristics** – usability, consistency, error tolerance  
- **Shneiderman’s Rules** – interface clarity, user control  
- **Google HEART** – emotional and satisfaction metrics  
- **Gerhardt-Powals** – cognitive effort and comprehension  
- **MeasuringU / UX Tweak / Dscout Signals** – task success and behavioral cues

> These were adapted for environments where access is a priority and capacity is constrained.

---

## 🧭 Using Without Direct User Testing

This scorecard intentionally supports **non-user-involved evaluations**, helping teams:

- Apply personas and scenario-based heuristics  
- Use structured grading to discuss pain points  
- Track emotional burden, access gaps, and comprehension challenges  
- Reflect collectively on design decisions in evolving systems

## 🕯️ Closing Note

This scorecard was shaped in quiet hours — with field notes, staff interviews, and creative refusals of the checkbox model.  
Use it where perfection is impossible and dignity is urgent.  
Adapt it, expand it, co-hold it.

We measure access not just by what’s usable — but by what welcomes.

With lantern light,  
**Ann K. Chou**
