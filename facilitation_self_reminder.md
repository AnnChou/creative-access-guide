# 🧠 A Soft Flow: Self-Guidance for Hard of Hearing Facilitators 
_Created for calm pacing, clear flow, and inclusive presence_

---

## 🌿 Grounding Intention

- I am leading with care — not perfection  
- My way of hosting is valid: **pauses, visuals, breathing time** are assets  
- I have the right to **co-create access**, not carry it all alone  
- Interdependence means I can ask for help, rest, or realignment

---

## 🔊 Before Facilitation

- ✅ Confirm caption tools are set (CART, live captions, script support)  
- 📝 Share agenda/slides ahead of time so everyone can orient gently  
- 🧩 Brief assistants or co-hosts on backup cues or timekeeping  
- 💬 Let participants know how to communicate clearly with me:
  - Face me when speaking
  - Use chat or gesture if needed
  - Rephrase rather than repeat if I ask again

---

## 🗣️ During Facilitation

- 💡 It’s okay to say: “Can you rephrase that?” or “Let me double-check I understood.”  
- 🐢 Slow down the flow — **I control the rhythm**  
- 🔁 I can check in: “Let’s take a moment to pause, reflect, and breathe”  
- 🤝 Let participants contribute access when needed — **it's not all mine to hold**

---

## 🍵 When I Feel Overwhelmed

- I may use my gentle interruption phrase:
  - _“Hey, I’m going to pause us so I can catch up fully.”_  
- I can ask for:
  - Caption adjustment
  - Restatement in simpler language
  - Text instead of audio, if clearer
- Taking a 3-minute regroup is **valid and welcomed**

---

## 🕊️ End of Session

- 💬 Ask others: “What supported your access today?”  
- 🧘 Reflect inward: “Did I feel heard, steady, and collaborative?”  
- 🌱 Celebrate what flowed, and note what to adjust next time

> **Access isn’t just external — it’s how I care for myself while facilitating.**  
> My neurodivergence, my hearing pace, my rhythm — they lead how the room breathes.
