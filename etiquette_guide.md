# 🧏‍♀️ Inclusive Communication & Meeting Etiquette  
_Crafted by Ann K. Chou | Rooted in interdependence and disability-led collaboration_

## 🌿 Purpose  
To support accessible, creative communication for blind, deaf, hard-of-hearing, neurodivergent, and community-rooted participants — in online, in-person, and hybrid spaces.

Access is rhythm, not rigidity. Creativity flows through many modalities.

## 🌱 Before We Meet

- 📬 Share agenda, slides, and inspiration 24–48 hours in advance  
- 🗣️ Confirm requests for CART, captions, interpreters, or alternate formats  
- 🛠️ Choose platforms that support captions, visuals, and multi-modal input  
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Allow support via assistants or care partners  
- 🎨 Include creative prompts (e.g. sketch, object reflection, shared metaphor)

## 🎤 During Our Time Together

- 💡 Face toward light — ensure mouth, face, and expression are visible  
- 🧏‍♂️ Speak clearly, avoid jargon, and pause between ideas  
- 🎧 Enable captions, CART, or transcription  
- ✋ Use gestures, reaction icons, objects, or emojis to supplement meaning  
- 📐 Respect pacing and silence — allow time for processing and care  
- 🧍 Normalize non-verbal and alternative communication (movement, visuals, text)  
- 👥 Allow assistant or support partner contributions where needed

## 🧘 Break Time & Sensory Care

- ⏰ Plan breaks every 60–90 minutes  
- 🌾 Provide quiet and social break options  
- 💬 Invite check-ins on fatigue, emotion, and sensory needs  
- 🍵 Offer space to pause, stretch, hydrate, or rest

---

## 💬 Language Practices

- ✅ Use person-centered, neutral language  
- ❌ Avoid terms like “normal,” “able-bodied,” “suffering from,” “low/high functioning”  
- 📣 Name speakers before talking; allow pronouns and identities to be self-chosen  
- 🫱 Accept multiple forms of presence — listening, typing, gesture, silence, creative modes

---

## 📄 After We Part

- ✏️ Share transcripts, visual notes, and annotated materials  
- 📥 Invite feedback on access, pacing, and inclusion  
- 🌱 Reflect together — “What might grow next time?”
