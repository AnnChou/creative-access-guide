# 📖 Accessibility Resources by Ann K. Chou  
*Welcome to a lantern-lit space of access, creativity, and co-care.*

This repository holds living resources designed to support inclusive communication across abilities — especially for blind, deaf, hard-of-hearing, neurodivergent, and community-rooted collaborators.

## 🌟 Access as Care, Not Accommodation

These materials were born from the inside.

As someone who is **hard of hearing and neurodiverse**, my earliest guides focused on communication accessibility for conversations, meetings, and creative workspaces. Initially created for in-person gatherings, they offered practical tools and affirming language for clearer, kinder collaboration.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, online spaces opened up new possibilities for cross-disability connection — and my guides began to evolve. Collaborating with other disabled creatives, we shaped tools grounded in **interdependence**, **sensory care**, **anti-stigma language**, and **shared access culture**.

When the director of my **UBC Behavioural Insight Foundation course** asked for my communication guide — after noticing it in my email signature — I understood how these resources could travel beyond disability circles. They belong to anyone cultivating dignity in how we meet, create, and collaborate.

## 🦮 Guide Dog Welcome Poster

Created during my **WorkAble internship**, this sign invites service and guide dogs not just legally, but **culturally and emotionally**.  
Suitable for print, signage, or digital sharing in inclusive spaces.

**Alt-text**:  
> Illustration of a guide dog in harness entering a warmly lit art space. Text reads: “Service & Guide Dogs Welcome — This is a space of care, calm, and companionship.”

## 🌱 Interdependent Practices

The expanded rider used by our cross-disability working group also includes:

- 🍵 Planned break times to honor **sensory pacing, caregiving, and fatigue**  
- 🧘 Language guidelines to **reduce stigma and ableist framing**  
- 🤝 Affirmation of support via **assistants or care partners**  
- 🌍 Respect for shifting communication modes — **text, gesture, silence, visual, tactile**

This public guide reflects those values, with space to grow.
