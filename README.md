# 📖 README Intro: Accessibility Resources by Ann K. Chou
## Welcome to a lantern-lit space of access, creativity, and co-care.

This repository holds living resources designed to support inclusive communication across abilities — especially for blind, deaf, hard-of-hearing, neurodivergent, and community-rooted collaborators.

## Access as care, not accommodation.

These materials were born from the inside.

As someone who is hard of hearing and neurodiverse, my earliest guides focused on communication accessibility for conversations, meetings, and creative workspaces. Initially created for in-person gatherings, they offered practical tools and affirming language for clearer, kinder collaboration.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, online spaces opened up new possibilities for cross-disability connection — and my guides began to evolve. Collaborating with other disabled creatives, we shaped tools grounded in interdependence, sensory care, anti-stigma language, and shared access culture.

When the director of my UBC Behavioural Insight Foundation course reached out to ask for my communication guide — after seeing it in my email signature — I knew these tools could resonate beyond disability circles. They belong to anyone cultivating dignity in how we meet, create, and collaborate.

🌱 Interdependent Practices
The expanded rider used by our cross-disability working group also includes:
- 🍵 Planned break times to honor sensory pacing, caregiving, and fatigue
- 🧘 Language recommendations to reduce stigma and ableist framing
- 🤝 Affirmation of access support via assistants or care partners
- 🌍 Respect for shifting communication modes: text, gesture, silence, visual, tactile

This public guide reflects that ethos, with space for adaptation.

## 🕯️ Footer Message
These resources began in shared silence and steady listening — shaped through lantern-lit collaboration across disabled creatives during the pandemic.
They aren't policies, but poems of care.
Access is not a checklist, it's a commitment.
May this repository be a quiet companion for those building new worlds, where everyone arrives whole.

With ink, rhythm, and lantern light, — Ann K. Chou   (@annreflection)  [https://annchou.github.io](https://annchou.io.github.io)
