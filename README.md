# 📖 README Intro: Accessibility Resources by Ann K. Chou
## Welcome to a lantern-lit space of access, creativity, and co-care.

This repository holds living resources designed to support inclusive communication across abilities — especially for blind, deaf, hard-of-hearing, neurodivergent, and community-rooted collaborators.

These guides were born from my pre-COVID work in in-person communication equity, then deepened through online collaboration across disability communities during the pandemic. What emerged is a practice of interdependence, and this repository reflects that: access as care, not accommodation.
