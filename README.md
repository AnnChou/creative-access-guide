# 📖 Accessibility Resources by Ann K. Chou  
*Welcome to a lantern-lit space of access, creativity, and co-care.*

This repository holds living resources designed to support inclusive communication across abilities — especially for blind, deaf, hard-of-hearing, neurodivergent, and community-rooted collaborators.

## 🌟 Access as Care, Not Accommodation

These materials were born from the inside.

As someone who is **hard of hearing and neurodiverse**, my earliest guides focused on communication accessibility for conversations, meetings, and creative workspaces. Initially created for in-person gatherings, they offered practical tools and affirming language for clearer, kinder collaboration.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, online spaces opened up new possibilities for cross-disability connection — and my guides began to evolve. Collaborating with other disabled creatives, we shaped tools grounded in **interdependence**, **sensory care**, **anti-stigma language**, and **shared access culture**.

When the director of my **UBC Behavioural Insight Foundation course** asked for my communication guide — after noticing it in my email signature — I understood how these resources could travel beyond disability circles. They belong to anyone cultivating dignity in how we meet, create, and collaborate.

## 🦮 Service & Guide Dog Welcome Poster

Created during my **WorkAble internship**, this visual sign affirms that service and guide dogs are not only legally permitted, but **culturally embraced** in creative and collaborative spaces.

**Alt-text**:  
> Illustration of a guide dog in harness accompanying a gender-neutral person as they approach the entrance of a warmly lit art space. Text reads: “Service & Guide Dogs Welcome Here — Everyone deserves access."
🖨️ This poster is print-friendly and can be shared digitally or used as signage at events, workshops, and studios. It signals that **access and dignity walk beside us.**

## 🌱 Interdependent Practices

The expanded rider used by our cross-disability working group also includes:

- 🍵 Planned break times to honor **sensory pacing, caregiving, and fatigue**  
- 🧘 Language guidelines to **reduce stigma and ableist framing**  
- 🤝 Affirmation of support via **assistants or care partners**  
- 🌍 Respect for shifting communication modes — **text, gesture, silence, visual, tactile**

This public guide reflects those values, with space to grow.

## 🧮 Access-Centered UX Scorecard (Work in Progress)

A developing resource for public sector and service design teams aiming to evaluate user experience through an accessibility lens — especially when **direct user testing is limited**.

Designed by **Ann K. Chou**, this scorecard blends:
- Behavioral insight frameworks  
- Inclusive design literature  
- Equity-centered UX prompts

### 🧠 Key Features (in spreadsheet format)
- Five structured tabs for:
  - Dimensions of access  
  - Interpretive grading scale  
  - Persona-grounded reflection  
  - Comprehension and emotional burden metrics  
  - Notes for iteration and internal dialog

This tool helps teams **internalize access as a quality**, not a checkbox — and invites thoughtful UX evaluation across inclusive dimensions.
